# <a name="billing-overview"></a>Billing overview

Aplica-se a:

- Partner Center
- Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program

## <a name="find-your-bill"></a>Find your bill

To find your bill:

1. [Sign in to the Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-hand menu, choose **Billing**.
3. On the **Billing** page, you can download your latest bill or download previous bills in the **Billing history** section.

## <a name="bill-your-customers"></a>Bill your customers

Microsoft has no requirements or conditions about how you handle your own invoicing.

To determine a customer's usage, [see your reconciliation files](#find-your-bill). You can use the customer name and other relevant fields to determine usage.

Next, you can add your own fees and charges for services and products that you provide. Then, you can send a single bill for all charges to your customer.

### <a name="billing-types"></a>Billing types

Billing types in Partner Center include **license-based billing**, **usage-based billing**, and **one-time billign**. For more information, see the full explanation of [billing types in Partner Center](billing-different-types.md).

### <a name="billing-currency"></a>Billing currency

You'll be billed for product(s) in the currency of the country or region in which you're located. You're billed the same regardless of the location of the customer to whom you sold the product(s).

## <a name="invoices"></a>Faturas

Your invoice is a summary of all charges for the current billing period. This includes charges across the program, all products, and all customers. For examples of monthly and annual billing scenarios, see [common billing scenarios](common-billing-scenarios.md)

Your invoice is available within two (2) days of your selected billing date in UTC time. For example, if you have a September 12th billing date, the invoice generation process will begin at 12:00AM UTC on the 13th and complete by 12:00AM UTC on the 14th. If you do not see your invoice by 11:59PM UTC on the 15th, you’re out of your Service Level Agreement and should file a service request.

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program who choose to be billed monthly pay Microsoft 60 days in arrears for their customers' subscriptions (both license-based and usage-based).

## <a name="price-lists"></a>Price lists

Price lists are updated monthly. Preview price lists are available one (1) month in advance.

To view price lists:

1. [Sign in to the Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-hand menu, choose **Sell**, then select **Pricing and offers**.
3. On the **Pricing and offers** page, you can see 6 months of price lists (including the current month) and preview price lists (where applicable).

**License-based** prices are guaranteed for the term of the subscription, usually 12 months from the purchase date. 

**Usage-based prices** can change on a monthly basis.

**Prices for products, services, and software subscriptions** are guaranteed through the subscription duration. However, prices may change when you renew.

You'll see **adjustments** and **credits** in arrears on your next billing invoice after the credit or adjustment is applied.

## <a name="payment-terms"></a>Termos de pagamento

Payment terms are net 60 days. Invoices must be paid by the invoice due date (60 days after the billing date), or your account will be delinquent, which may impact your enrollment in CSP. 

You can regain full functionality of your suspended accounts when you pay the past due amount.

### <a name="taxes-and-vat"></a>Taxes and VAT

You are taxed based on your details (not your customers' details) because the billing relationship is between Microsoft and you. You can submit your tax identifier during the account setup process or through a support request later. Você verá as alterações refletidas no seu próximo ciclo de cobrança.

For **withholding and sales tax exemption**, you must submit tax documentation through a support request. Você verá as alterações e reembolsos apropriados em seu próximo ciclo de cobrança.

For **value-added tax (VAT) exemption**, you must submit your VAT ID (validated by Microsoft) through a service request. Você verá as alterações e reembolsos apropriados em seu próximo ciclo de cobrança.

You can find further tax details from your local tax office or tax advisor.

### <a name="annual-billing-rules"></a>Annual billing rules

As assinaturas são anuais com renovação automática.

A cobrança é feita em 12 pagamentos mensais ou um anual por assinatura anual.

Você será cobrado com antecedência pelo próximo período de cobrança pelos serviços baseados em licença, de acordo com o número de licenças no final do período de cobrança anterior.

Você é cobrado/creditado em atraso de pagamento por alterações no número de licenças (cálculo proporcional com base em dias de licença). Pro-rata calculation uses the following formula:

`[ROUND((ROUND(Unit Price * Quantity / Number of days in pro-rated Month, 2) * Number of pro-rated days) / Quantity, 2) * Quantity]`

Payments are billed for licenses sold, not licenses provisioned.

### <a name="change-billing-frequency"></a>Change billing frequency

To change the billing frequency of an online service for a customer:

1. [Sign in to the Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-hand menu, choose **Customers**.
3. Select the customer whose subscription billing frequency you want to change.
4. On the customer's **Subscriptions** page, select the subscription that you want to change.
5. On the **Details** page, under **Billing frequency**, select **Monthly** or **Annual**. You’ll see a confirmation page with important information about changing billing frequency, as well as a list of the subscriptions about to be changed.
6. Choose **OK** to make the change (or **Cancel** to undo it).

### <a name="adjustmentscreditscancellations"></a>Ajustes/créditos/cancelamentos

Microsoft does not charge early termination fees for cancellation of license-based services.

Cancellation credits for licensed-based services are pro-rated for unused days for mid-cycle cancellations (as well as license decreases according to the formula above).

### <a name="billing-rules"></a>Regras de cobrança

Subscriptions are month-to-month and automatically renew at the new metered service rates. You're billed each month for the previous month's usage.

As taxas de serviço limitadas podem ser alteradas dentro do ciclo de fatura.

#### <a name="price-changes"></a>Price changes

For **price increases**, 30 days' notice is provided.

**Price decreases** are reflected on the day of change.

**Existing subscriptions** use the rate in effect at the beginning of the bill cycle.

**New subscriptions**, when created within the same billing cycle, use the rate in effect on the date you create them. 

### <a name="adjustmentscreditscancellations"></a>Ajustes/créditos/cancelamentos

Você verá pagamentos com ajustes em sua próxima fatura de cobrança mensal.

Microsoft does not charge early termination fees for cancellation of usage-based services. 

Você verá créditos de qualquer tipo, incluindo créditos SLAs, em sua próxima fatura de cobrança mensal.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you purchase Azure reservations and/or software subscriptions for a customer in a location with a currency different from yours, the default billing currency is based on the customer’s location, not your location. If you have customers in multiple locations, you’ll receive separate invoices and reconciliation files for each currency customers need to be billed in, allowing you to invoice your customers in the appropriate currency.

## <a name="manage-one-time-billing"></a>Manage one-time billing

### <a name="billing-status-invoices-and-reconciliation-files"></a>Billing status, invoices and reconciliation files

To view your current billing status, invoices, and reconciliation files:

1. [Sign in to the Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. On the left-hand menu, choose **Billing**, then select **One time**.
3. On the billing status page, select an invoice or reconciliation file to view more detailed information.

### <a name="customer-order-history"></a>Customer order history

1. [Sign in to the Partner Center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. On the left-hand menu, choose **Customers**.
3. On the **Customers** page, find the customer whose order history you want to view. Select the down arrow to expand the customer's record.
4. Choose **View orders** to display the customer's order history.

### <a name="credit-notes"></a>Credit notes

You might need to request a credit or rebill for the following reasons:

- You need to make address or purchase order corrections.
- A tax refund was applied after the invoice was generated. You can request a credit or rebill to get the tax refund pulled back into the original invoice. The same is also true for refunds. You can request a credit or rebill of the original invoice, then pull in a refund.

If you request a credit or rebill, we'll give you a **credit note** to cancel the original invoice.
