# <a name="taxes-and-tax-exemptions"></a>Impostos e isenções fiscais

Aplica-se a:

- Partner Center
- Partner Center do Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program is a sales channel focused on partner resale of products. As a result, Microsoft is not always required to charge sales tax on partner invoices. The rules vary by country and/or region. You can review [country-specific and region-specific details for tax exemptions](#country-and-region-tax-details).

Partners should work with their tax advisor to [file tax exemptions](#file-tax-exemptions) based on their locations and where their customers are based.

## <a name="country-and-region-tax-details"></a>Country and region tax details

Specific tax-related information is available for the following countries and regions: [Canada](#canada), [the European Union](#european-union), [South Africa](#south-africa), [Turkey](#turkey), and [the United States](#united-states). For Taiwan and Korea, see [tax receipts details](#tax-receipts-and-daf).

If you're in another country or region that charges taxes, see [the information for other regions](#other-regions).

For additional questions, [request support in Partner Center](#support).

### <a name="south-africa"></a>África do Sul

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in South Africa. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="turkey"></a>Turquia

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in Turkey. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="united-states"></a>Estados Unidos

Todos os revendedores nos Estados Unidos devem fornecer uma documentação de isenção de imposto em até 30 dias depois de aceitar o Contrato de Revendedor da Microsoft. Cada estado tem certificados de isenção diferentes para revenda. Trabalhe com seu consultor de imposto para determinar o que é relevante para seu endereço legal e estados registrados.

This may include resale exemption certificates that work across multiple states such as the *Streamline Sales* and *Use Tax Agreement Certificate of Exemption* or the *MTC Uniform Sales & Use Tax Exemption Certificate*.
